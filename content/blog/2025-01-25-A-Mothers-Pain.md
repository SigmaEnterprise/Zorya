**A Mother's Pain**

A mother’s pain, so deep, unseen,  
Lies heavy on her heart, serene.  
Through sleepless nights, and tearful days,  
She walks alone, through life’s maze.  
  
Her smile hides the ache within,  
A quiet strength, where doubts begin.  
She carries burdens, though she’s worn,  
With dreams for children yet unborn.  
  
The weight of love, it never ends,  
Through broken hearts and shattered bends.  
Her silent cries, the world can't hear,  
But in her eyes, we see her fear.  
  
A mother's pain, a silent song,  
The battle fought, the whole day long.  
Yet still, she rises, every dawn,  
Her love, the light that keeps her strong.

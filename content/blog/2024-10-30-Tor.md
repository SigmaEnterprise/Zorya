*Setting Up the Tor Package Repository on Debian-Based Systems*

Enabling the Tor package repository on Debian and Debian-based distributions, such as Ubuntu, can help ensure you receive the latest updates directly from the Tor project. Follow the steps below to set up and install the Tor package securely on your system. 

**Important:** The `#` symbol denotes commands that should be run as the root user or with `sudo` privileges.

---

### Step 1: Verify Your CPU Architecture

To ensure compatibility, confirm your CPU architecture supports the Tor package binaries. The repository offers binaries for `amd64`, `arm64`, and `i386`. Run the following command to check your system's architecture:

```bash
# dpkg --print-architecture
```

Expected outputs should be either `amd64`, `arm64`, or `i386`. Note that 32-bit ARM (`armhf`) is not yet supported directly by the Tor project repository, so users with that architecture should install Tor from Debian‚Äôs repositories or build it from source.

---

### Step 2: Install `apt-transport-https`

To securely access Tor‚Äôs repository over HTTPS, install `apt-transport-https`, which is required for secure connections:

```bash
# apt install apt-transport-https
```

---

### Step 3: Configure the Tor Package Repository

1. **Create a New Source List File:** Open or create `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/tor.list` and add the following repository entries:

   ```plaintext
   deb     [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/deb.torproject.org-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org <DISTRIBUTION> main
   deb-src [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/deb.torproject.org-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org <DISTRIBUTION> main
   ```

   Replace `<DISTRIBUTION>` with your OS codename. You can find it by running:

   ```bash
   # lsb_release -c
   ```

   or:

   ```bash
   # cat /etc/debian_version
   ```

2. **Optional: Add Experimental or Nightly Builds**

   For those who want experimental or nightly builds, add the lines below to the same file:

   **Experimental:**
   ```plaintext
   deb     [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/deb.torproject.org-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org tor-experimental-<DISTRIBUTION> main
   deb-src [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/deb.torproject.org-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org tor-experimental-<DISTRIBUTION> main
   ```

   **Nightly Builds:**
   ```plaintext
   deb     [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/deb.torproject.org-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org tor-nightly-main-<DISTRIBUTION> main
   deb-src [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/deb.torproject.org-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org tor-nightly-main-<DISTRIBUTION> main
   ```

---

### Step 4: Add the GPG Key for Tor Packages

**Installing a Tor Relay**

To ensure package integrity, download and add the GPG key used to sign Tor packages:

```bash
# wget -qO- https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89.asc | gpg --dearmor | tee /usr/share/keyrings/deb.torproject.org-keyring.gpg >/dev/null
```

---

### Step 5: Update Package List and Install Tor

Now that the repository is set up, update your package list and install Tor along with the Tor Debian keyring package:

```bash
# apt update
# apt install tor deb.torproject.org-keyring
```

---

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Warning:** You may encounter an error message when updating if the repository doesn‚Äôt support your architecture:

```plaintext
Skipping acquire of configured file 'main/binary-i386/Packages' as repository 'http://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org focal InRelease' doesn't support architecture 'i386'
```

To fix this, ensure that you‚Äôre using the correct architecture and repository settings.

---

By following these steps, you‚Äôll be set up to receive secure, up-to-date Tor packages directly from the Tor project on your Debian-based system. This setup ensures you‚Äôre always using the latest secure version of Tor for your privacy needs.

# Setting Up a Tor Relay on Debian-Based Systems

Setting up a Tor relay enhances online privacy and helps support the Tor network. Follow this guide to create a Tor relay on a Debian-based system. This tutorial includes setting up automatic system updates for security, installing Tor, configuring the relay, and monitoring traffic.

## Part 1: Setting Up Unattended Upgrades

Enabling unattended upgrades will keep your system updated with minimal effort, ensuring you receive critical security patches automatically.

### Step 1: Update Repositories and Install `unattended-upgrades`

First, update your repositories and install the required packages:

```bash
apt update
apt-get install unattended-upgrades apt-listchanges
```

### Step 2: Configure Unattended Upgrades

Open the configuration file to customize the upgrade settings:

```bash
nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades
```

![Remove This](https://kajabi-storefronts-production.kajabi-cdn.com/kajabi-storefronts-production/file-uploads/blogs/2147512644/images/bc742c2-17f0-0767-6fa5-47d3ebbb1e36_Pasted_image_20231028095641.png)
Remove any unnecessary configuration, then add the following settings:

```plaintext
Unattended-Upgrade::Allowed-Origins {
    "${distro_id}:${distro_codename}-security";
    "TorProject:${distro_codename}";
};
Unattended-Upgrade::Package-Blacklist {
};
Unattended-Upgrade::Automatic-Reboot "true";
```

This configuration ensures that security updates and Tor packages are automatically upgraded.

### Step 3: Test Unattended Upgrades

Run a test to confirm the settings are working:

```bash
unattended-upgrade --debug
```

---

## Part 2: Installing Tor

Installing Tor requires adding the official Tor repositories and GPG keys.

### Step 1: Add Official Tor Repositories

Install the HTTPS transport package for secure access to the repository:

```bash
apt install apt-transport-https
```

Check your Debian version:

```bash
cat /etc/debian_version
```

Create a new source file for Tor:

```bash
nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tor.list
```

Add the following lines to the file, replacing `{yourdistro}` with your Debian version:

```plaintext
deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/tor-archive-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org {yourdistro} main
deb-src [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/tor-archive-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org {yourdistro} main
```

### Step 2: Add the GPG Key

To authenticate Tor packages, add the Tor project‚Äôs GPG key:

```bash
wget -qO- https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89.asc | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/tor-archive-keyring.gpg >/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Install Tor

Update your package list and install Tor:

```bash
apt update
apt install tor deb.torproject.org-keyring
```

---

## Part 3: Configuring Tor

With Tor installed, configure it to function as a relay.

### Step 1: Open the Tor Configuration File

Edit the Tor configuration file:

```bash
nano /etc/tor/torrc
```

### Step 2: Add the Relay Configuration

Add the following configuration to the file:

```plaintext
## BASE CONFIG
Nickname YourRelayNickname
ContactInfo your@e-mail
ORPort 443
ExitRelay 0
SocksPort 0

## BANDWIDTH
# Sets a monthly bandwidth limit (up/down) of 800GB, starting on the 1st at midnight.
AccountingMax 800 GB
AccountingStart month 1 0:00

## MONITORING
ControlPort 9051
CookieAuthentication 1
```

Replace `YourRelayNickname` and `your@e-mail` with your chosen relay name and email address.

### Step 3: Enable and Restart Tor

To apply the changes, enable Tor at startup and restart the service:

```bash
systemctl enable tor
systemctl restart tor
```

---

## Part 4: Monitoring Tor with Nyx

Nyx is a command-line monitoring tool for Tor relays that provides real-time statistics.

### Step 1: Install Nyx

Install Nyx with:

```bash
apt install nyx
```

### Step 2: Run Nyx

Launch Nyx to start monitoring your Tor relay:

```bash
nyx
```

---

Setting up a Tor relay on a Debian-based system is a great way to contribute to internet privacy. With unattended upgrades configured, your system will remain secure with minimal maintenance. Additionally, Nyx provides essential insights into relay performance, helping you monitor and maintain your relay efficiently.

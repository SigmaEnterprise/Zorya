Mostro Network: Pioneering Censorship-Resistant Bitcoin Exchange
================================================================

Mostro Network, an avant-garde project initiated on November 6, 2023, unfolds a revolutionary approach to facilitate Bitcoin transactions through the Lightning Network. The project addresses the growing demand for conducting Bitcoin transactions without compromising personal data, introducing a groundbreaking solution for peer-to-peer exchanges.

Project Genesis: @lnp2pBot on Telegram
--------------------------------------

The inception of Mostro Network traces back to the initiation of @lnp2pBot on Telegram, a testament to enabling users worldwide to buy and sell Bitcoin via the Lightning Network. The bot operates organically, gaining traction globally, with a significant impact observed in Latin America, where the adoption of Bitcoin transcends the limitations of local currencies, especially in regions facing dictatorial regimes such as Cuba and Venezuela.

While @lnp2pBot thrived on Telegram, concerns arose about potential censorship by powerful entities. To mitigate this risk, the quest for a platform impervious to censorship led to the discovery of Nostr.

Enter Nostr: A Sanctuary for Decentralized Communication
--------------------------------------------------------

Nostr emerges as the ideal platform for hosting the Mostro Network, providing a haven where the bot can thrive without the looming threat of censorship. The exploration of Nostr began a month ago, with a focus on creating a new bot versionâ€”a censorship-resistant iteration, aptly named the "Monster" version.

The initial steps involve crafting a Nostr bot in Rust, a language known for its reliability and performance. This nascent implementation marks the beginning of a journey toward creating an unstoppable and censorship-resistant peer-to-peer exchange on the Lightning Network.

Mostro Architecture and Operation
---------------------------------

### Escrow Mechanism for Enhanced Security

Mostro acts as an escrow service, mitigating risks for both buyers and sellers in Bitcoin transactions. Leveraging a Lightning Network node, Mostro generates hold invoices for sellers and pays buyers using regular Lightning invoices, ensuring a secure and efficient exchange.

### Establishing a Decentralized Network of Mostros

To avoid a single point of failure, the Mostro Network encourages the creation of multiple Mostros, each contributing to the reliability of the network. Operating a Mostro requires a lightning node with substantial liquidity, ensuring rapid and secure transactions. Mostros sustain themselves through fees charged on successful orders.

### Reputation System for Quality Assurance

Users have the power to rate Mostros, fostering competition among Mostros to attract more users. A robust reputation system ensures that subpar Mostros are rejected by users, losing incentives to persist.

Order Flow: A Seamless Process
------------------------------

The order flow on Mostro Network follows a well-defined and secure process:

1.  **Order Publication:**
    
    *   Buyers and sellers communicate their intent by sending encrypted messages to Mostro.
    *   Mostro creates Parameterized Replaceable Events for potential trades.
2.  **Buyer Takes an Order:**
    
    *   Buyers send regular invoices and encrypted messages to Mostro.
    *   Mostro connects buyers with sellers by creating hold invoices.
3.  **Mostro Puts Parties in Touch:**
    
    *   After the seller pays the invoice, Mostro updates the order status to "Active."
    *   Mostro facilitates communication between buyer and seller.
4.  **Fiat Transaction Confirmation:**
    
    *   The buyer sends fiat money to the seller and notifies Mostro through encrypted messages.
5.  **Release of Funds:**
    
    *   Mostro requests the release of funds from the seller.
6.  **Invoice Settlement:**
    
    *   Mostro settles the seller's invoice and pays the buyer's invoice, updating the order status accordingly.

The detailed specifications and communication protocols can be found in the Mostro documentation, providing a comprehensive guide for users and developers alike.

Call to Rust Developers: Join the Mostro Revolution!
----------------------------------------------------

Mostro Network is in its early stages, and Rust developers are invited to contribute to this groundbreaking project. The journey has just begun, and early participants have the opportunity to shape the future of decentralized, censorship-resistant Bitcoin exchanges. Happy hacking!

Conclusion: A New Frontier in Bitcoin Exchange
----------------------------------------------

Mostro Network, hosted on the resilient platform of Nostr, emerges as a beacon of innovation in the realm of decentralized Bitcoin exchanges. With a focus on security, reliability, and censorship resistance, Mostro sets the stage for a new era in peer-to-peer transactions, empowering users globally to engage in Bitcoin transactions without compromising on privacy or succumbing to external pressures. As the project evolves, the Mostro Network promises to be a transformative force in the world of cryptocurrency.

Mostro Client Specifications: A User-Friendly Guide
===================================================

Overview
--------

Mostro, the innovative peer-to-peer exchange platform, operates through Parameterized Replaceable Events, utilizing event kind 38383. This ensures a standardized communication protocol for seamless interactions. To better understand the communication process, let's delve into the details of Mostro's client specifications.

Communication with Mostro
-------------------------

All messages exchanged with Mostro adhere to Nostr event kind 4. The content field of the event is a crucial element, employing base64 encoding and AES-256-CBC encryption for security. The content field contains a JSON-serialized string with specific parameters:

*   **version:** Indicates the protocol version (currently 1).
*   **pubkey (optional):** The real pubkey of the user, used for message signing when sent from ephemeral keys.
*   **action:** Specifies the action to be performed by the Mostro daemon.
*   **content (optional):** Provides additional content based on the action performed.

Here's an example of a FiatSent Order message:

    {
      "Order": {
        "version": 1,
        "id": "ede61c96-4c13-4519-bf3a-dcf7f1e9d842",
        "pubkey": "0001be6bd50247846a28cce439a10470a39b1b6c81d5c3be2475156a413e1e3a",
        "action": "FiatSent",
        "content": null
      }
    }
    

Key Management
--------------

Key management is crucial for secure communication. In the examples provided, the following keys are used:

*   **Mostro's pubkey:** dbe0b1be7aafd3cfba92d7463edbd4e33b2969f61bd554d37ac56f032e13355a
*   **Seller's real pubkey:** 00000ba40c5795451705bb9c165b3af93c846894d3062a9cd7fcba090eb3bf78
*   **Seller's ephemeral pubkey:** 1f5bb148a25bca31506594722e746b10acf2641a12725b12072dcbc46ade544d

Initiating a Dispute on Mostro: A Step-by-Step Guide
====================================================

Introduction
------------

Users on Mostro have the option to initiate a dispute in an order with the status "Pending" or "FiatSent." This guide outlines the process of starting a dispute, the responses from Mostro to the seller and buyer, and the subsequent actions taken by Mostro and administrators.

### Step 1: Initiating a Dispute

A user can start a dispute by sending the following action in a Nostr event:

    {
      "Order": {
        "version": 1,
        "id": "ede61c96-4c13-4519-bf3a-dcf7f1e9d842",
        "pubkey": "00000ba40c5795451705bb9c165b3af93c846894d3062a9cd7fcba090eb3bf78",
        "action": "Dispute",
        "content": null
      }
    }
    

### Step 2: Mostro's Response to the Seller

Mostro responds to the seller with the following message:

    {
      "Order": {
        "version": 1,
        "id": "ede61c96-4c13-4519-bf3a-dcf7f1e9d842",
        "pubkey": null,
        "action": "DisputeInitiatedByYou",
        "content": null
      }
    }
    

### Step 3: Mostro's Response to the Buyer

Mostro sends a message to the buyer:

    {
      "Order": {
        "version": 1,
        "id": "ede61c96-4c13-4519-bf3a-dcf7f1e9d842",
        "pubkey": null,
        "action": "DisputeInitiatedByPeer",
        "content": null
      }
    }
    

### Step 4: Updating the Nip 33 Event

Mostro does not update the nip 33 event with the "d" tag "ede61c96-4c13-4519-bf3a-dcf7f1e9d842" to change the status to "Dispute." This is because the order is still active, and the dispute serves as a notification to administrators and the other party about a problem with the order.

### Step 5: Mostro's Nip 33 Event to Show the Dispute

Mostro broadcasts a nip 33 event to show the dispute, for example:

    [
      "EVENT",
      "RAND",
      {
        "id": "4a4d63698f8a27d7d44e5669224acf6af2516a9350ae5f07d3cb91e5601f7302",

        "created_at": 1703016565,
        "kind": 38383,
        "tags": [
          ["d", "efc75871-2568-40b9-a6ee-c382d4d6de01"],
          ["s", "Pending"],
          ["y", "mostrop2p"],
          ["z", "dispute"]
        ],
        "content": "",
        "sig": "00a1da45c00684c5af18cf292ca11697c9e70f2a691e6cd397211e717d2f54362dd401d7567da8184a5c596f48a09693479e67214c23e773523a63d0b1c3f537"
      }
    ]
    

### Step 6: Administrator Actions

Mostro administrators can view the dispute using the dispute ID "efc75871-2568-40b9-a6ee-c382d4d6de01" and take action:

          }
        }
      }
    }
    

### Step 8: Broadcasting the Nip 33 Dispute Event

Mostro broadcasts a new nip 33 dispute event to update the dispute status to "InProgress":

    [
      "EVENT",
      "RAND",
      {
        "id": "2bb3f5a045bcc1eb057fd1e22c0cece7c58428a6ab5153299ef4e1e89633fde9",
        "pubkey": "dbe0b1be7aafd3cfba92d7463edbd4e33b2969f61bd554d
    }

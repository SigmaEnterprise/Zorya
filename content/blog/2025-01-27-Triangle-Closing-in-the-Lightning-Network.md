The Lightning Network preserves decentralization as it expands, allowing nodes to join or leave freely and open payment channels at any time. This flexible structure ensures no single entity can control the entire network. Built as a peer-to-peer system of payment channels layered on the Bitcoin blockchain, the Lightning Network’s decentralized design grows stronger with each new node or channel. As the network scales, the "effective diameter" — or the average distance between nodes — decreases, which improves routing efficiency by making nodes closer to one another, eliminating the need for centralized intermediaries. You can explore this concept further [here](https://github.com/lnbook/lnbook/blob/develop/16_security_privacy_ln.asciidoc) and [here](https://github.com/lnbook/lnbook/blob/develop/03_how_ln_works.asciidoc).

#### Triangle Closing in the Lightning Network

In traditional social networks, "triangle closing" occurs when three nodes form connections to create a triangular relationship. However, this behavior is uncommon in the Lightning Network. Nodes aren’t inherently incentivized to close triangles since they can route payments using existing channels rather than opening new ones. 

Before multipart payments (MPP) were implemented, some nodes opted to close triangles as a workaround for routing inefficiencies. This involved creating direct channels instead of relying on existing routes. The advent of MPP has significantly improved routing efficiency, reducing the need for triangle closures. Learn more about triangle closing and its implications in the Lightning Network [here](https://github.com/lnbook/lnbook/blob/develop/16_security_privacy_ln.asciidoc).

#### Multipart Payments (MPP): Enhancing the Lightning Network

Multipart payments (MPP) are a game-changing feature that boosts the Lightning Network’s efficiency and reliability. Here are some key benefits of MPP:

1. **Higher Payment Success Rates**: MPP enables users to split payments into smaller parts sent through multiple routes, increasing the chances of successfully completing transactions. This is particularly valuable when a single channel lacks sufficient liquidity for the entire payment. Read more about this [here](https://github.com/lnbook/lnbook/blob/develop/12_path_finding.asciidoc).
   
2. **Atomic Transactions**: MPP ensures all parts of a payment are completed simultaneously or not at all, preserving transaction integrity. Learn more about this feature [here](https://github.com/lnbook/lnbook/blob/develop/12_path_finding.asciidoc).

3. **Support for Larger Payments**: By splitting large payments into smaller, channel-friendly chunks, MPP enables the processing of transactions that would otherwise exceed channel capacities. Details are available [here](https://github.com/lnbook/lnbook/blob/develop/12_path_finding.asciidoc).

4. **Improved Routing Efficiency**: As MPP adoption grows, routing becomes more streamlined, reducing the need for inefficient practices like triangle closing. Find out more [here](https://github.com/lnbook/lnbook/blob/develop/16_security_privacy_ln.asciidoc).

#### Node Operators: The Backbone of the Lightning Network

Node operators are crucial to the Lightning Network’s operation, ensuring its scalability and reliability. Here’s how they contribute:

1. **Payment Routing**: Node operators maintain channels that facilitate seamless payment transfers between nodes, enabling transactions without requiring direct connections between parties. Discover the specifics [here](https://github.com/lnbook/lnbook/blob/develop/05_node_operations.asciidoc).

2. **Enhancing Network Connectivity**: By strategically opening or closing channels, operators influence the network’s topology, improving overall robustness and efficiency. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/lnbook/lnbook/blob/develop/05_node_operations.asciidoc).

3. **Earning Routing Fees**: Operators earn fees for routing payments, creating an economic incentive that could encourage broader participation as the network scales. Read more about routing fees [here](https://github.com/lnbook/lnbook/blob/develop/16_security_privacy_ln.asciidoc).

4. **Strengthening Security and Privacy**: By operating decentralized nodes, operators help eliminate single points of failure and enhance the network’s resilience. Additional insights are available [here](https://github.com/lnbook/lnbook/blob/develop/16_security_privacy_ln.asciidoc).

#### Effective Diameter: Key to Efficient Payment Routing

The "effective diameter" of the Lightning Network measures the average number of hops required for payments to travel between nodes. A smaller effective diameter benefits the network in several ways:

1. **Faster and More Efficient Payments**: Fewer hops mean quicker and less resource-intensive payment processing. Learn more [here](https://github.com/lnbook/lnbook/blob/develop/16_security_privacy_ln.asciidoc).

2. **Greater Reliability**: Payments are less likely to fail when there are fewer intermediaries, reducing the risk of issues like liquidity shortages or channel failures. Details are available [here](https://github.com/lnbook/lnbook/blob/develop/16_security_privacy_ln.asciidoc).

3. **Lower Transaction Fees**: Shorter payment routes lead to reduced cumulative fees, making transactions more cost-effective. Find out more [here](https://github.com/lnbook/lnbook/blob/develop/16_security_privacy_ln.asciidoc).

4. **Simpler Channel Management**: Fewer hops simplify network maintenance, benefiting both users and node operators. Learn about network topology management [here](https://github.com/lnbook/lnbook/blob/develop/16_security_privacy_ln.asciidoc).

By prioritizing a small effective diameter, the Lightning Network continues to position itself as a fast, reliable, and efficient solution for off-chain Bitcoin transactions.

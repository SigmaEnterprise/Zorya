**HAVEN** is a groundbreaking personal relay for the Nostr protocol, designed to provide ultimate sovereignty and privacy. It offers secure storage and backup for sensitive notes such as eCash, private chats, drafts, and more. Unlike traditional relays, HAVEN is feature-rich, integrating advanced tools like Web of Trust, inbox relay functionality, cloud backups, and the ability to import historical notes. It even includes its own Blossom Media Server, making it a versatile solution for both personal and public use.

### A Multifunctional Relay System + Blossom Media Server  

HAVEN stands out by combining **four distinct relays** and a **media server**, each tailored to serve specific purposes:  

#### 1. **Private Relay**  
   - Exclusively accessible to the relay owner.  
   - Ideal for storing drafts, eCash, and other confidential notes.  
   - Fully protected with authentication, ensuring no unauthorized reading or writing access.  

#### 2. **Chat Relay**  
   - Dedicated for private communication via direct messages (DMs).  
   - Interaction is limited to those in the owner's Web of Trust and is secured with authentication.  
   - Supports encrypted DMs and group chat types, ensuring conversations remain private.  

#### 3. **Inbox Relay**  
   - Acts as the owner's reading hub for zaps, reactions, and replies.  
   - Automatically pulls tagged notes from other relays to create a centralized feed.  
   - Only accepts notes where the owner is tagged, ensuring efficient filtering and organization.  

#### 4. **Outbox Relay**  
   - A public repository for all notes created by the owner.  
   - Allows importing of old notes to maintain a complete archive.  
   - Automatically blasts notes to other relays for broader distribution.  
   - Only the owner can send to this relay, but anyone can read its contents.  

#### 5. **Blossom Media Server**  
   - Integrated media server for hosting images and videos.  
   - Relay owners can upload media and generate shareable links.  
   - Media is accessible for public viewing, but only the owner can upload.

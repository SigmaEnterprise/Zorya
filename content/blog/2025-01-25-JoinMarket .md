### **JoinMarket**

**JoinMarket** is a tool for enhancing Bitcoin transaction privacy through CoinJoin. It allows users to obfuscate the transaction history by pooling funds with other users in a decentralized manner. Here's an overview of its key features and steps to get started:

#### **Features:**
1. **Two Modes of Use:**
   - **Maker:** Provides liquidity for CoinJoin and earns fees passively.
   - **Taker:** Initiates CoinJoin transactions to enhance privacy.
   
2. **Privacy Enhancement:**
   - Breaks direct links between inputs and outputs in Bitcoin transactions.
   - Can be combined with Tor for additional anonymity.

3. **Flexibility and Control:**
   - Choose specific UTXOs for CoinJoin.
   - Fine-tune fee rates and transaction sizes.

4. **Automation:**
   - Scripts for automating tasks like wallet generation and CoinJoin.

5. **Open Source:**
   - Fully auditable and customizable.

#### **Getting Started with JoinMarket**
1. **Install JoinMarket:**
   - Clone the repository from GitHub:  
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver.git
     cd joinmarket-clientserver
     ```
   - Set up dependencies using the provided `install.sh` script.
   
2. **Generate Wallets:**
   - Use the `wallet-tool.py` to create a new wallet:  
     ```bash
     python wallet-tool.py generate
     ```
   - Backup the wallet seed securely.

3. **Run JoinMarket:**
   - **Maker Mode:** Start providing liquidity:  
     ```bash
     python yg-privacyenhanced.py wallet.jmdat
     ```
   - **Taker Mode:** Initiate a CoinJoin transaction:  
     ```bash
     python sendpayment.py wallet.jmdat <amount> <destination>
     ```

4. **Integrate with Tor:**
   - Set up Tor and configure JoinMarket to route communication through it for additional anonymity.

5. **Monitor and Troubleshoot:**
   - Logs and verbose modes help debug or fine-tune operations.

### **Building a Highly Private and Anonymous File Server or Communication Platform**

Using tools like **Tor**, **Torsocks**, **Nginx**, and **IPFS**, you can create a secure, private file-sharing or communication platform. Below is a step-by-step guide:

#### **1. Setting Up Tor**
- **Install Tor:**
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install tor
  ```
- **Edit Tor Configuration:**
  Open `/etc/tor/torrc` and configure a hidden service:
  ```bash
  HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/
  HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80
  ```
  Restart Tor:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart tor
  ```
- **Obtain Onion Address:**
  The onion address is located in `/var/lib/tor/hidden_service/hostname`.

#### **2. Integrating Torsocks**
- **Install Torsocks:**
  ```bash
  sudo apt install torsocks
  ```
- **Route Commands Through Tor:**
  Prepend `torsocks` to commands, e.g.:
  ```bash
  torsocks curl https://check.torproject.org
  ```

#### **3. Setting Up Nginx for Hidden Services**
- **Install Nginx:**
  ```bash
  sudo apt install nginx
  ```
- **Configure Nginx for Local Access:**
  Create a server block in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`:
  ```nginx
  server {
      listen 80;
      server_name localhost;

      location / {
          root /var/www/html;
          index index.html;
      }
  }
  ```
  Restart Nginx:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart nginx
  ```
- **Access via Tor:**
  Use your onion address (e.g., `http://example.onion`) to access the server privately.

#### **4. Using IPFS for Decentralized File Hosting**
- **Install IPFS:**
  Follow the instructions from [IPFS Docs](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/).
- **Initialize and Start IPFS:**
  ```bash
  ipfs init
  ipfs daemon
  ```
- **Add Files to IPFS:**
  ```bash
  ipfs add /path/to/file
  ```
  Share the generated IPFS hash via Tor.

#### **5. Combining Tor, Torsocks, and IPFS**
- Route IPFS traffic through Tor using Torsocks:
  ```bash
  torsocks ipfs daemon
  ```

#### **6. Advanced Privacy Techniques**
- **Tor Bridges:** Use obfuscated bridges for environments hostile to Tor.
- **Hardened Nginx Config:** Disable unnecessary modules and enforce HTTPS with a self-signed certificate.
- **Access Control:** Use basic auth, macaroons, or JWT for additional authentication layers.
- **Monitor Logs Privately:** Route logs through secure storage like encrypted disks.
